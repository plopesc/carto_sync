Installation
============

You are strongly encouraged to install the module using composer. If you already
use composer in your project all you need to do is to run:

composer require drupal/carto_sync

If you are downloading the module manually, make sure you include also all
dependencies, such as the "geofield" contrib module, as well as the
https://github.com/thephpleague/csv external library.
